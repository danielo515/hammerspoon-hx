## Hammerspoon bindings for Haxe

This lib is an ongoing effort to bind the whole Hammerspoon Lua API to be used from Haxe.
The bindings are added as I need them, but feel free to suggest new ones or to open a PR adding or improving them.

For a better experience, I suggest to keep the Hammerspoon docs page open while you use this library, as this is
just a 1:1 mapping of it.
I tried to keep the same comments that Hammerspoon has in the binding docs, but some may be missing. You are warned.

## Real world usage

If you want to see this project used in a real world application, you can take a look at my StreamDeckButton spoon here:
